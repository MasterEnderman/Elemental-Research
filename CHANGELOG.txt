1.3.0
===
-Added configs for enabling elements/setting points per action/etc
-Replace "XP" text with an XP icon
-Replaced & moved the arrow buttons
-Expanded the width of shop buttons by 30 px
-Shop entry costs will no longer overlap with descriptions, at least to the 100s place
-Re-added descriptions, they should now log an error instead of crash if they fail (I still have no idea why they ever failed..)
-Shop entries are now identified by UUID rather than integers in a list, this should properly preserve shop data for users
 even after entries are added and removed with crafttweaker. A legacy adapter was added, so this should not crash old worlds
-Added a 'priority' field to shop entries i.e. ``entry3.priority = 20`` for sorting which order shop entries are displayed
-Added new modifier logic types for ``addRequiredStagesWithModifier`` , "FOREACH_OR" and "FOREACH_AND" -
 these will multiply the modifier by the number of stages unlocked. The behavior of "OR" and "AND" has not changed
 they use standard boolean logic and will only apply the modifier once as long as the AND|OR condition is met
